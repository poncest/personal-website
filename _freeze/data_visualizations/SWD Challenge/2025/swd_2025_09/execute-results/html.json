I chose to redesign my own traffic flow dashboard using the TidyTuesday (2024 wk 49) National Highways Traffic Flow dataset.\n\n## The Problem: Information Overload\n\n### Original Dashboard - The \"Before\"\n\n![Baseline dashboard with multiple tabs, cluttered interface, and unclear focus](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/poncest/SWDchallenge/main/2025/09_Sep/img/01_before_app.PNG){#fig-before}\n\n**Key Issues Identified:**\n\n-   **Multiple tabs** scattered related insights across different views\n-   **Too many controls** (sensor picker, date range, day type, hour slider, plotly toggle, KPI toggle)\n-   **Unclear audience** - tried to serve everyone, served no one well\n-   **No visual hierarchy** - everything competed for attention\n-   **Analysis paralysis** - users didn't know where to start or what questions to ask\n\n\nThe original dashboard suffered from a common problem: attempting to show *everything* at once rather than guiding users toward the most important insights.\n\n## Audience & Analytical Needs\n\n### Target Users: Transport Planners & Local Policy Staff\n\n**Primary Questions They Need Answered:**\n\n1. **How is daily volume trending this month?** (For capacity planning)\n2. **What's the weekday vs weekend hourly profile?** (For staffing and maintenance scheduling)  \n3. **Which sensor shows consistently different patterns?** (For identifying problem areas)\n\n\n**Secondary Needs:** \n\n- Quick overview metrics at a glance \n- Ability to focus on specific date ranges \n- Simple comparison between weekday/weekend patterns \n- Minimal cognitive load - they're busy people\n\n\n## The Solution: Focused Clarity\n\n### Redesigned Dashboard - The \"After\"\n\n![Clean, focused dashboard with three KPIs and two strategic charts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/poncest/SWDchallenge/main/2025/09_Sep/img/02_after_app.PNG){#fig-after}\n\n### Key Design Decisions\n\n**1. Single Page Layout** \n\n- Eliminated tabs to keep related insights together \n- Created clear visual hierarchy with KPIs at top\n\n\n**2. Streamlined Controls (3 vs 8)** \n\n- Date range selector (essential for time-series analysis) \n- Sensor selection (allows focus on specific locations) \n- Weekday/Weekend toggle (key operational insight)\n\n\n**3. Strategic KPIs** \n\n-   **Avg daily volume:** 28,906 (capacity planning) \n-   **Median speed:** 44 mph (performance monitoring) \n-   **% large vehicles:** 3.8% (infrastructure wear planning)\n\n\n**4. Two Focused Charts** - **Daily traffic volume** with trend line (answers trending question) - **Weekday vs Weekend profile** (answers operational scheduling question)\n\n\n## Interactive Versions\n\n-   **Baseline App (Before):** https://0l6jpd-steven-ponce.shinyapps.io/01_before_app/\n-   **Makeover App (After):** https://0l6jpd-steven-ponce.shinyapps.io/02_after_app/\n\n*Navigation: Use the simple sidebar controls to filter by date range, select specific sensors, or toggle between weekday and weekend patterns.*\n\n## Design Impact & Results\n\n### What Changed\n\n-   **Reduced cognitive load** from 8 controls to 3\n-   **Eliminated navigation** from 5 tabs to 1 page\n-   **Focused insights** from scattered metrics to strategic KPIs\n-   **Clear visual hierarchy** guiding users from summary to detail\n\n### Questions Now Easily Answered\n\n✅ **\"How's traffic trending?\"** - Immediately visible in main chart with trend line\\\n✅ **\"When are peak hours?\"** - Clear hourly profile shows morning/evening peaks\\\n✅ **\"Weekend vs weekday differences?\"** - Toggle comparison built into interface\\\n✅ **\"Which location needs attention?\"** - Sensor comparison readily available\n\n### What Users Gain\n\n-   **Faster insights** - key metrics visible within seconds\n-   **Actionable intelligence** - focused on decisions they actually need to make\n-   **Reduced training time** - intuitive interface needs minimal explanation\n-   **Mobile-friendly** - simplified layout works on smaller screens\n\n## Technical Implementation\n\nThe redesign was built using R Shiny with the National Highways Traffic Flow dataset from TidyTuesday 2024 Week 49, covering A64 road sensors during May 2021.\n\n### Data Source Details\n\n-   **Source:** WebTRIS Traffic Flow API via TidyTuesday (2024 wk 49)\n-   **Coverage:** 4 sensors on A64 road, May 2021\n-   **Granularity:** Hourly vehicle counts, speeds, and size classifications\n-   **Volume:** \\~30K daily average across all sensors\n\n### Key Technical Choices\n\n-   **Single reactive dataset** instead of multiple data processing streams\n-   **Conditional rendering** based on user selections rather than separate tabs\n-   **Optimized calculations** focusing on the three key metrics that matter most\n-   **Simplified interactivity** - removed unnecessary plotly complexity\n\n## Reflection & Lessons Learned\n\n### What Worked Well\n\n-   **Less is more** - Removing features improved usability dramatically\n-   **User-centered design** - Focusing on specific audience transformed the experience\n-   **Visual hierarchy** - Clear information architecture guides user attention effectively\n\n### What I'd Do Differently Next Time\n\n-   **User testing** - Would validate assumptions with actual transport planners\n-   **Progressive disclosure** - Could add \"deep dive\" option for power users\n-   **Contextual help** - Brief explanations of what \"good\" looks like for each metric\n\n### Key Takeaway\n\nThe most powerful dashboards don't show everything possible - they show everything *necessary* for specific users to make specific decisions.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Session Info\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n##### Expand for Session Info\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nR version 4.4.1 (2024-06-14 ucrt)\nPlatform: x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64\nRunning under: Windows 11 x64 (build 22631)\n\nMatrix products: default\n\n\nlocale:\n[1] LC_COLLATE=English_United States.utf8 \n[2] LC_CTYPE=English_United States.utf8   \n[3] LC_MONETARY=English_United States.utf8\n[4] LC_NUMERIC=C                          \n[5] LC_TIME=English_United States.utf8    \n\ntime zone: America/New_York\ntzcode source: internal\n\nattached base packages:\n[1] stats     graphics  grDevices datasets  utils     methods   base     \n\nloaded via a namespace (and not attached):\n [1] htmlwidgets_1.6.4 compiler_4.4.0    fastmap_1.2.0     cli_3.6.4        \n [5] htmltools_0.5.8.1 tools_4.4.0       rstudioapi_0.17.1 yaml_2.3.10      \n [9] rmarkdown_2.29    knitr_1.49        jsonlite_1.8.9    xfun_0.49        \n[13] digest_0.6.37     rlang_1.1.6       renv_1.0.3        evaluate_1.0.1   \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n## Code Repository\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n##### Expand for Code Access\n\n-   **QMD File:** [swd_2025_09.qmd](https://github.com/poncest/personal-website/tree/master/data_visualizations/SWD%20Challenge/2025/swd_dashboard_2025_09.qmd)\n-   **Baseline App:** https://github.com/poncest/SWDchallenge/tree/main/2025/09_Sep/01_before_app\n-   **Makeover App:** https://github.com/poncest/SWDchallenge/tree/main/2025/09_Sep/02_after_app\n-   **Full Repository:** [Personal Website Repo](https://github.com/poncest/personal-website/)\n\n:::\n\n## References\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n##### Expand for References\n\n**Challenge Details:** -
