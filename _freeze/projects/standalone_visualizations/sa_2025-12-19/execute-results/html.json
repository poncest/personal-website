This project explores how to design a single Shiny application that supports executive, operations, and revenue decisions—without sacrificing clarity, performance, or trust.\n\nThis project explores how to design a **single Shiny application** that supports three distinct decision-makers—without sacrificing usability, performance, or narrative focus. The goal was not to visualize everything, but to help the *right people* answer the *right questions* quickly.\n\n> **Note:** All data, benchmarks, and financial impacts shown here are **synthetic and illustrative**, used solely to demonstrate analytical thinking and dashboard design.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## The challenge\n\nRail operations generate vast amounts of data—journeys, delays, ticket sales, booking patterns—but these signals are often fragmented across systems. As a result:\n\n- Executives struggle to spot performance shifts quickly\n- Operations teams lack a unified view of delay drivers\n- Revenue analysts miss cross-route pricing and concentration risks\n\nThe challenge wasn't building *a* dashboard. It was building **three dashboards in one**, each tailored to a distinct stakeholder—without creating a cluttered, one-size-fits-all interface that satisfies no one.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Designing for three personas\n\nRather than present everything at once, the dashboard is structured around three clear use cases.\n\n### Executive overview\n\n**Purpose:** Monitor performance at a glance, identify trends, and surface opportunities\n\n**Key elements:**\n\n- Four headline KPIs with month-over-month trend indicators\n- A one-sentence executive takeaway using consulting-style language\n- Daily journey volume trends for context\n- A concise insights panel summarizing what matters most\n\n![Executive Overview showing KPIs with trend indicators, executive summary, and daily performance trends.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/poncest/UK_train_operations/main/screenshots/executive_overview.png){#fig-1}\n\n### Operations analytics\n\n**Purpose:** Diagnose delay drivers and prioritize operational interventions\n\n**Key elements:**\n\n- Time-period filtering (Morning Peak, Evening Peak, Off-Peak)\n- Route-level delay rate analysis\n- Delay reason breakdown highlighting root causes\n- Severity distribution showing operational impact\n\n![Operations Analytics with time period filtering, delay diagnostics, and route performance metrics.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/poncest/UK_train_operations/main/screenshots/operations_analytics.png){#fig-2}\n\n### Revenue intelligence\n\n**Purpose:** Analyze booking behavior, pricing patterns, and revenue concentration\n\n**Key elements:**\n\n- Booking window analysis (same-day vs. advance)\n- Revenue by time period\n- Ticket price distribution\n- Channel performance (online vs. station)\n- Route-level revenue concentration metrics\n\n![Revenue Intelligence analyzing pricing strategies, booking patterns, and channel performance.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/poncest/UK_train_operations/main/screenshots/revenue_intelligence.png){#fig-3}\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Key insights from the data\n\n### Network performance (Jan–Apr 2024)\n\n**Takeaway:** Reliability is strong, but volume softness and delay duration still pose risk.\n\n- 31,653 journeys generated £742k in revenue (£23.44 average fare)\n- 92.8% on-time performance (above 89% industry benchmark)\n- 7.2% delay rate, with average delays of 42.5 minutes when they occur\n\n### Route concentration risk\n\n**Takeaway:** A small number of routes drive a disproportionate share of value.\n\n- Top 5 routes account for 28% of total journey volume\n- Manchester Piccadilly → Liverpool Lime Street leads with 5,128 journeys\n- Top 10 routes represent 45% of total revenue, increasing concentration risk\n\n### Operational patterns\n\n**Takeaway:** Delays cluster in predictable windows, enabling targeted intervention.\n\n- Morning Peak has the highest delay rate (12.5%)\n- Weather is the leading delay cause (42.8%), followed by Technical Issues (18.3%)\n- Delay patterns are consistent by time period, not random\n\n### Digital adoption gap\n\n**Takeaway:** Channel migration represents a clear near-term opportunity.\n\n- 58.5% digital adoption vs. 65% industry benchmark\n- Online channel generates 51.6% of revenue despite 58.5% of volume\n- Lower average online fares suggest pricing or product mix opportunity\n\n### Revenue optimization potential\n\n**Takeaway:** Yield management levers remain underutilized.\n\n- Peak fares are +40.3% higher than off-peak\n- Only 12.1% of tickets are purchased 8+ days in advance\n- 62% of tickets fall in the \"Budget\" category (<£15)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Design decisions that elevated the dashboard\n\nFive specific choices that elevated usability and stakeholder engagement:\n\n### 1. Executive takeaway box\n\nA single, consulting-style summary at the top of the Executive tab reframed how users engage:\n\n> *Core service reliability remains strong (92.8% on-time), while recent softness in journey volume and sub-benchmark digital adoption indicate near-term opportunities in demand stimulation and channel migration.*\n\nThis immediately answers: *What's working? What's not? What should we do next?*\n\n### 2. Trend indicators on KPIs\n\nMonth-over-month arrows provide context that raw numbers cannot. Executives care more about **direction** than magnitude.\n\n### 3. Info tooltips for clarity\n\nSubtle ℹ️ icons explain metrics like \"Digital Adoption\" without cluttering the interface, reducing friction for new users.\n\n### 4. Unified visual language\n\nA restrained color palette replaced early rainbow gradients, resulting in a cohesive, consulting-grade aesthetic.\n\n### 5. Horizontal bar charts\n\nLong route and time-period labels remain readable, reducing cognitive load and improving scanability.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Technical architecture\n\nThe application uses a **modular Shiny architecture** optimized for performance through aggressive reactive caching.\n\n### Core structure\n\n- `app.R` — Main application entry point\n- `R/mod_executive.R` — Executive overview module\n- `R/mod_operations.R` — Operations analytics module\n- `R/mod_revenue.R` — Revenue intelligence module\n\n### Technology stack\n\n- **shiny.semantic** — Modern Semantic UI framework\n- **ggiraph** — Interactive, hover-enabled charts\n- **reactable** — Professional data tables\n- **ggplot2 + dplyr + tidyr** — Data manipulation and visualization\n- **bindCache()** — Reactive caching for performance\n\n### Performance results\n\n- Initial load time reduced from ~8–10 seconds to <2 seconds\n- Expensive computations cached\n- Summary metrics pre-aggregated\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Making the dashboard production-ready\n\n### Dependency management\n\n- Removed all `install.packages()` calls from runtime code\n- Used explicit package imports\n- Excluded development artifacts via `.rscignore`\n\n### Modal implementation\n\n- Used Semantic UI modals (`create_modal()`) instead of `shiny::modalDialog()`\n- Ensured reliable triggering via JavaScript event handling\n\n### Deployment\n\n```r\nrsconnect::deployApp(\n  appName = \"UK_train_operations\",\n  forceUpdate = TRUE\n)\n```\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Strategic recommendations\n\nThe following recommendations are illustrative examples of how this dashboard could support strategic decision-making.\n\n### 1. Channel migration initiative\n\n**Goal:** Increase digital adoption from 58.5% → 65%\n\n**Tactics:**\n\n- Incentivize first-time online booking\n- Improve mobile UX\n- Expand digital partnerships\n\n**Expected impact:** +£45k annual revenue (illustrative)\n\n### 2. Peak period capacity management\n\n**Goal:** Reduce Morning Peak delay rate from 12.5% → 9.0%\n\n**Tactics:**\n\n- Add rolling stock on high-impact routes\n- Dynamic crew scheduling\n\n**Expected impact:** +3.5pp on-time performance\n\n### 3. Revenue optimization\n\n**Goal:** Increase advance booking rate from 12.1% → 18%\n\n**Tactics:**\n\n- Advance-purchase discounts\n- Fare bundling experiments\n\n**Expected impact:** +£28k annual revenue (illustrative)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Five lessons from building executive-grade dashboards\n\n1. **Clarity beats completeness** — Fewer metrics, better decisions\n2. **Performance matters** — Slow dashboards don't get used\n3. **Language matters** — Consulting-style framing builds credibility\n4. **Design is strategic** — UX decisions shape adoption\n5. **Documentation is part of the product** — Explaining *why* matters as much as *how*\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Potential extensions\n\nIf this were a production deployment, next priorities would include:\n\n- Predictive delay forecasting using historical patterns\n- Automated alert system for performance anomalies\n- Integration with real-time operations data\n- Mobile-optimized responsive design\n- Multi-language support for international routes\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Closing takeaway\n\nEffective business intelligence isn't about showing all available data—it's about answering the right questions for the right people. In dashboard design and stakeholder communication alike, **clarity consistently beats complexity**.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Session Info\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n##### Expand for Session Info\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nR version 4.4.1 (2024-06-14 ucrt)\nPlatform: x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64\nRunning under: Windows 11 x64 (build 26100)\n\nMatrix products: default\n\n\nlocale:\n[1] LC_COLLATE=English_United States.utf8 \n[2] LC_CTYPE=English_United States.utf8   \n[3] LC_MONETARY=English_United States.utf8\n[4] LC_NUMERIC=C                          \n[5] LC_TIME=English_United States.utf8    \n\ntime zone: America/La_Paz\ntzcode source: internal\n\nattached base packages:\n[1] stats     graphics  grDevices datasets  utils     methods   base     \n\nloaded via a namespace (and not attached):\n [1] htmlwidgets_1.6.4 compiler_4.4.0    fastmap_1.2.0     cli_3.6.4        \n [5] htmltools_0.5.8.1 tools_4.4.0       rstudioapi_0.17.1 yaml_2.3.10      \n [9] rmarkdown_2.29    knitr_1.49        jsonlite_1.8.9    xfun_0.49        \n[13] digest_0.6.37     rlang_1.1.6       renv_1.0.3        evaluate_1.0.1   \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n## GitHub Repository\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n##### Expand for GitHub Repo\n\n[Access the GitHub repository here](https://github.com/poncest/UK_train_operations)\n:::\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## References\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n##### Expand for References\n\n- Maven Analytics — UK Train Operations (Synthetic Dataset)\n- Shiny Documentation: <https://shiny.posit.co/>\n- Appsilon shiny.semantic: <https://appsilon.github.io/shiny.semantic/>\n- ggiraph: <https://davidgohel.github.io/ggiraph/>\n- reactable: <https://glin.github.io/reactable/>\n:::\n",
