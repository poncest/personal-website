Framing the problem]{.smallcaps}\n\nPre-launch planning in pharmaceutical commercialization involves\ndecisions under substantial uncertainty. Brand teams must commit to\nlaunch timing, resource allocation, and forecast ranges while facing\nunknowns about regulatory approval timing, manufacturing readiness, and\nmarket reception.\n\nThe natural instinct is to seek precision: better models, more data,\ntighter confidence intervals. But in practice, the harder problem is\noften **structuring the conversation** around forecast ranges,\nrevenue-at-risk, and timing shifts—rather than eliminating uncertainty\nentirely.\n\nThis project approaches launch forecasting as a **governance and framing\nproblem**, rather than a prediction exercise. The objective is not to\nforecast whether a specific launch will succeed, but to quantify **how\nanalog selection and timing assumptions translate into revenue\nrisk**—making trade-offs explicit for cross-functional discussion.\n\nIn practice, this means shifting the question from \"What will happen?\"\nto \"What are we implicitly assuming—and what does that assumption cost\nif it's wrong?\"\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## [2. The core decision question]{.smallcaps}\n\nThe framework is designed around a single, actionable question:\n\n**What is the revenue at risk if launch timing shifts under\nuncertainty?**\n\nThis question matters because it connects analytical work directly to\ndecisions that leadership teams actually face:\n\n-   How much revenue exposure exists in Year 1 if launch slips by one or\n    two quarters?\n-   What forecast commitment range (P25/P50/P75) is defensible given\n    analog variation?\n-   How sensitive are these conclusions to which analogs are included?\n\nIn practice, timing assumptions also propagate into manufacturing\nreadiness, commercial resourcing, and financial guidance—making early\nuncertainty costly to unwind later.\n\nRather than producing point forecasts, the framework surfaces **ranges\nand trade-offs** that support structured executive discussion.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## [3. Why governance-first analog selection]{.smallcaps}\n\nAnalog-based forecasting is common in pharmaceutical commercial\nplanning. The challenge is that analog selection is inherently\nsubjective—and post-hoc adjustments can undermine credibility.\n\nThis framework applies a **governance-first methodology**:\n\n1.  **Define inclusion criteria before examining outcomes** —\n    Therapeutic area, peak revenue threshold, and data availability\n    requirements are specified upfront.\n2.  **Lock the analog list in writing** — No modifications after seeing\n    revenue performance.\n3.  **Document rationale for every inclusion/exclusion** — Creates an\n    audit trail for reviewers.\n4.  **Test sensitivity explicitly** — Option to exclude the\n    top-performing analog tests whether conclusions depend on outliers.\n\nThis approach addresses a common critique of analog analysis: that\nanalysts cherry-pick comparators to support predetermined conclusions.\nBy separating selection criteria from outcome examination, the framework\nsurvives skeptical review.\n\nThis governance-first approach is operationalized in the app through\nfour components: **Executive Brief** (scenario comparison and trade-off\nframing), **Scenario Builder** (criteria configuration and sensitivity\ntesting), **Analog Explorer** (individual product examination with\nguardrails), and **Methods & Data** (assumption documentation and scope\nboundaries).\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## [4. What the framework quantifies]{.smallcaps}\n\n### Revenue-at-Risk Estimation\n\nThe framework calculates Year 1 revenue at risk under configurable\nlaunch delay scenarios:\n\n```         \nRevenue at Risk (Year 1) = delay_quarters × (median Year 1 revenue / 4)\n```\n\nYear 1 is used because it is the period most sensitive to launch timing\nassumptions and the least confounded by later competitive or lifecycle\neffects.\n\nThis is explicitly labeled as a **Year 1 average-quarter\napproximation**—a simplification that provides directional magnitude\nwithout implying DCF-level precision.\n\n### Scenario Bands from Analog Variation\n\nPercentile bands (P25/P50/P75) are derived from observed analog\nperformance:\n\n-   **P50 (Base Case):** Median analog trajectory\n-   **P75 (Upper Range):** Upper quartile performance\n-   **P25 (Lower Range):** Lower quartile performance\n\nThese represent **observed variation across analogs**, not statistical\nconfidence intervals. The distinction matters: they quantify historical\nheterogeneity, not forecasting uncertainty.\n\n### Selection Statistics\n\nDynamic statistics update as criteria change:\n\n-   Solid tumor vs. hematology count\n-   Approval year range\n-   Median peak revenue\n-   Number of analogs meeting criteria\n\nThis transparency helps users understand what's driving the scenario\nrange.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## [5. Key assumptions documented]{.smallcaps}\n\nThe framework relies on several simplifying assumptions that users\nshould understand:\n\n**Demand deferral, not destruction**\\\nDelayed demand is assumed to shift forward in time rather than being\npermanently lost. Competitive dynamics and access erosion are not\nmodeled.\n\n**Label expansion bias**\\\nSome analogs experienced significant post-launch indication expansions,\ncreating potential upward bias in peak revenue estimates. Products\nwithout similar expansion potential may underperform these benchmarks.\n\n**Era effects**\\\nLaunch dynamics differ between earlier (2013–2015) and more recent\noncology approvals. The analog set includes both eras, which may\nintroduce heterogeneity.\n\n**US-weighted revenue**\\\nSEC filing data may include global revenue. Geographic mix differences\nbetween analogs and forecasted products are not adjusted.\n\nThese assumptions are documented in the Methods & Data tab and surfaced\nin the dashboard interface to prevent over-interpretation.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## [6. What this framework does—and does not—do]{.smallcaps}\n\n### What it does\n\n✅ Structures analog-based launch scenario analysis\\\n✅ Quantifies revenue ranges from analog variation (P25/P50/P75)\\\n✅ Supports structured trade-off conversations under uncertainty\\\n✅ Documents assumptions and limitations transparently\\\n✅ Provides sensitivity checks to test analytical robustness\n\n### What it does not do\n\n❌ Predict whether a specific launch will succeed\\\n❌ Recommend specific investment or resourcing levels\\\n❌ Model competitive response or market access dynamics\\\n❌ Estimate NPV or financial returns\\\n❌ Replace clinical, regulatory, or strategic judgment\n\n**By design:** NPV and market access modeling are excluded because they\nrequire company-specific inputs that would compromise generalizability.\nRevenue scenarios are treated as **foundational inputs** to financial\nmodeling, not final outputs.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## [7. Dashboard structure]{.smallcaps}\n\nThe application is organized into four complementary views:\n\n### Executive Brief\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/poncest/launch-curve-forecaster/main/screenshots/executive_brief.png)\n\nAn executive-facing summary that surfaces:\n\n-   Key metrics (analog count, peak revenue range, revenue at risk)\n-   Launch trajectory scenarios with P25/P50/P75 bands\n-   Two explicit decision trade-offs: launch timing and forecast\n    commitment\n-   Selected analog summary table\n\nThe decision boxes explicitly frame trade-offs in terms stakeholders\nrecognize: \"Speed vs. readiness\" and \"Alignment vs. credibility risk.\"\n\n### Scenario Builder\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/poncest/launch-curve-forecaster/main/screenshots/scenario_builder.png)\n\nAn interactive configuration view that allows users to:\n\n-   Select therapeutic focus (solid tumors, hematology, or both)\n-   Set minimum peak revenue thresholds\n-   Test sensitivity by excluding the top-performing analog\n-   Configure launch delay scenarios (0–4 quarters)\n\nThe Selection Rationale panel updates dynamically, showing live\nstatistics and a governance note reminding users that criteria should be\ndocumented before examining outcomes.\n\n### Analog Explorer\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/poncest/launch-curve-forecaster/main/screenshots/analog_explorer.png)\n\nA detailed view for examining individual analog characteristics:\n\n-   Side-by-side comparison of two selected analogs\n-   Launch curve visualization showing trajectory differences\n-   Characteristics table (company, indication, approval date, peak\n    revenue)\n-   Launch context factors that may have influenced trajectory\n\nThis tab includes guardrails against over-interpretation—users must\nclick \"View Details\" to load data, creating a deliberate interaction\nthat discourages casual browsing.\n\n### Methods & Data\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/poncest/launch-curve-forecaster/main/screenshots/methods.png)\n\nA transparency-focused section documenting:\n\n-   Framework overview and workflow diagram\n-   Data sources (FDA approvals, SEC EDGAR filings, published\n    literature)\n-   Inclusion and exclusion criteria\n-   Key assumptions with explicit discussion\n-   \"What This Framework Does NOT Do\" section\n-   Technical implementation details\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## [8. The analog set]{.smallcaps}\n\nThe framework includes 10 established oncology launches with\nproduct-level revenue disclosed in SEC filings:\n\n**Solid tumors (6):**\\\nKeytruda, Opdivo, Ibrance, Tagrisso, Lynparza, Tecentriq\n\n**Hematology (4):**\\\nImbruvica, Darzalex, Venclexta, Calquence\n\nThe 6/4 split reflects real-world prevalence rather than forced\nsymmetry. Adding weaker products to achieve balance would introduce more\nnoise than signal.\n\nApproval years range from 2013–2017, providing sufficient follow-up to\nobserve peak revenue while remaining recent enough to reflect modern\nlaunch dynamics.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## [9. Technical lessons from the build]{.smallcaps}\n\nThis project surfaced an important technical insight about Shiny\ndevelopment with CSS-based UI frameworks.\n\n### The Problem\n\nWhen using shiny.semantic (which relies on Semantic UI's CSS-based tab\nswitching), outputs don't render automatically when users navigate to a\ntab. Shiny's lazy evaluation assumes it knows when tabs become\nvisible—but CSS-based tabs don't notify Shiny of visibility changes.\n\n### The Solution\n\nAdding `outputOptions(output, \"output_name\", suspendWhenHidden = FALSE)`\nto all outputs forces Shiny to render regardless of perceived\nvisibility. This pattern isn't documented in standard Shiny guides but\nis essential for CSS-based tab frameworks.\n\nThis discovery—after several hours of debugging—became the most valuable\ntechnical lesson from the project.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## [10. Why this framing matters for commercial analytics]{.smallcaps}\n\nIn pharmaceutical commercial planning, forecasts are rarely wrong\nbecause of poor algorithms. They're wrong because:\n\n-   Analog selection was post-hoc rationalized\n-   Assumptions weren't documented or tested\n-   Ranges were too narrow to capture actual uncertainty\n-   Trade-offs weren't made explicit to decision-makers\n\nThis framework addresses these failure modes directly:\n\n-   **Governance-first selection** prevents cherry-picking\n-   **Documented assumptions** create audit trails\n-   **P25/P50/P75 bands** acknowledge inherent uncertainty\n-   **Explicit trade-off framing** connects analysis to decisions\n\nThe goal is not better predictions, but **better-structured\nconversations** about what forecasts can and cannot support.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## [Appendix: Methodology & Build Notes]{.smallcaps}\n\n### Data Sources\n\n-   **FDA Drug Approvals:** Approval dates (T=0), initial indications\n-   **SEC EDGAR Filings:** Product-level revenue from 10-K and 10-Q\n    reports\n-   **Published Literature:** Launch curve patterns and benchmarks from\n    peer-reviewed sources\n\n### Technical Stack\n\n-   **Language:** R (4.3+)\n-   **Framework:** Shiny (modular architecture)\n-   **UI:** shiny.semantic (Appsilon)\n-   **Visualization:** ggplot2, ggiraph\n-   **Tables:** reactable, reactablefmtr\n-   **Deployment:** shinyapps.io\n\n### Key Design Choices\n\n-   Revenue normalized to launch quarter (T=0) for comparability\n-   Percentiles calculated across analog set (not confidence intervals)\n-   Revenue scaled to millions USD for readability\n-   All data from public sources to ensure reproducibility\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Purpose, Scope, and Disclaimer\n\nThis project is a **portfolio case study** intended to demonstrate\nanalytical framing, governance, and decision-support design using\npublicly available data.\n\nIt is **not intended for real-world commercial decision-making** and is\nnot affiliated with any pharmaceutical company. Product names are used\nfor analytical illustration only.\n\nAll data are derived from publicly available sources including SEC\nfilings and FDA databases. No proprietary or confidential information is\nincluded.\n\nThis work does not constitute investment advice, commercial guidance, or\nstrategic recommendations.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Closing Reflection\n\n::: callout-note\nThe value of this framework lies not in its predictions, but in its\nstructure. By making analog selection defensible, assumptions\ntransparent, and trade-offs explicit, it provides a foundation for\n**disciplined commercial planning conversations**—conversations that\nconnect forecast ranges to revenue-at-risk and timing decisions to\nresource commitments.\n\nIn launch planning, clarity about what we don't know is often more\nvaluable than false confidence about what we do.\n:::\n",
