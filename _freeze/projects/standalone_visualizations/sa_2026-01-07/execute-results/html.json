Rather than predicting outcomes or recommending specific investments, the simulator provides a transparent framework for exploring **how portfolio strategies perform under different strategic priorities**.\n\nThe emphasis is on **decision support**, not prescription.\n\nFor organizations navigating pipeline trade-offs, this distinction matters: \nthe goal is clarity about *how* choices behave, not claims about *what* to choose.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Strategic Questions This Simulator Examines\n\nThe simulator is designed to help explore questions commonly faced by R&D leadership and portfolio governance teams:\n\n-   How do different portfolio configurations perform across competing strategic objectives?\n-   When do objectives align, and when do they meaningfully diverge?\n-   What trade-offs emerge between maximizing near-term approvals and building long-term optionality?\n-   How sensitive are portfolio outcomes to therapeutic area risk profiles?\n-   Under what conditions does specialization outperform diversification?\n\nThese questions are addressed through **probability-weighted simulation**, not forecasting.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Analytical Design: A Multi-Objective Framework\n\nRather than optimizing for a single outcome, portfolios are evaluated across **five strategic objectives**, each representing a different organizational priority:\n\n1.  **Maximize Expected Approvals** – total approvals over the portfolio lifecycle\\\n2.  **Predictability** – approvals per asset (execution reliability)\\\n3.  **Learning Optionality** – early-stage asset exposure as a proxy for discovery\\\n4.  **Speed to Market** – approvals per year\\\n5.  **Capital Efficiency** – approvals per \\$100M invested\n\nNo objective is treated as universally “correct.” Trade-offs are expected and explicitly surfaced.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Data Foundations and Modeling Discipline\n\n### Literature-Based Inputs\n\nBaseline parameters are drawn from peer-reviewed and industry sources, including:\n\n-   Phase transition success rates (Norstella / Citeline)\n-   Trial duration estimates (Wong et al., *Biostatistics*)\n-   R&D cost estimates (JAMA Network Open)\n-   Therapeutic-area-specific success profiles (ACSH)\n\nEmpirical therapeutic areas include:\n\n-   Overall (industry average)\n-   Oncology\n-   Vaccines\n-   Anti-Infectives\n\n### Modeled Strategic Scenarios\n\nWhere direct literature estimates do not exist, **explicit modeling assumptions** are applied to explore strategic postures (e.g., fast-track timelines, cost-efficient rare disease focus). These assumptions are documented, adjustable, and intentionally simplified.\n\nThe simulator distinguishes clearly between **empirical inputs** and **modeled scenarios**.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Simulation Approach\n\nPortfolio outcomes are calculated using **probability-weighted attrition modeling**.\n\nRather than assuming all assets progress through all phases, costs and timelines are weighted by historical phase-transition probabilities. This reflects real-world portfolio economics, where early failures reduce downstream costs and timelines.\n\nKey outputs include:\n\n-   Expected approvals\\\n-   Probability-weighted total cost\\\n-   Average development timeline\\\n-   Normalized efficiency metrics\n\nThis approach emphasizes **structural realism** over predictive precision.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Dashboard Structure\n\nThe simulator is organized into four complementary views:\n\n### Executive Brief\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/poncest/Pharma_R-D/main/screenshots/executive_brief.png)\n\nAn executive-facing entry point that allows users to select a strategic priority and view:\n\n-   Suggested portfolio configurations aligned with selected priority\\\n-   Key performance metrics\\\n-   Explicit trade-offs (“what improves” vs. “what is sacrificed”)\n\n### Portfolio Builder\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/poncest/Pharma_R-D/main/screenshots/portfolio_builder.png)\nAn interactive workspace for configuring:\n\n-   Phase allocation (early vs. late)\n-   Therapeutic area focus\n-   Cost assumptions\n\nwith real-time feedback against strategic KPIs and preset scenarios.\n\n### Trade-off Explorer\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/poncest/Pharma_R-D/main/screenshots/tradeoff_builder.png)\n\nA comparative analysis view that enables:\n\n-   Multi-scenario selection\\\n-   Normalized radar-chart comparison across objectives\\\n-   Side-by-side metrics with dynamic interpretation\n\n### Methods & Data\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/poncest/Pharma_R-D/main/screenshots/method_data.png)\n\nA transparency-focused section documenting:\n\n-   Data sources and citations\\\n-   Modeling assumptions\\\n-   Normalization logic\\\n-   Known limitations\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## What the Simulator Reveals\n\nAcross scenarios and assumptions, several consistent patterns emerge:\n\n-   Output-maximizing strategies tend to cluster, particularly when late-stage assets dominate the portfolio.\n-   Learning-focused portfolios often diverge from output-focused ones, highlighting a fundamental trade-off between near-term results and long-term optionality.\n-   Therapeutic area risk profiles materially affect outcome magnitude, even when strategy rankings remain stable.\n-   Under certain conditions, objectives align—simplifying decisions. Under others, trade-offs become unavoidable and must be made explicit.\n\nThese findings are descriptive, not prescriptive.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Scope and Limitations\n\nThis simulator intentionally does **not**:\n\n-   Predict individual asset outcomes\\\n-   Model company-specific pipelines or proprietary data\\\n-   Estimate valuation, NPV, or financial return\\\n-   Account for competitive dynamics or regulatory acceleration pathways\n\nLearning optionality is proxied by early-stage asset exposure, not measured scientific output.\\\nAll simulations assume independent trial outcomes and industry-average parameters.\n\nThese constraints are deliberate to preserve interpretability and avoid overreach.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Why This Framework Is Useful\n\nStrategic portfolio discussions often fail not due to lack of data, but due to **implicit priorities and unexamined trade-offs**.\n\nThis simulator provides a structured way to:\n\n-   Make priorities explicit\\\n-   Compare strategies on common footing\\\n-   Explore sensitivity to assumptions\\\n-   Support disciplined executive discussion\n\nIt is designed as a **thinking tool**, not a decision engine.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Appendix: Methodology & Build Notes {.collapse}\n\n### Data Sources\n\n- Norstella/Citeline (2024) – Phase transition probabilities\n- Wong et al., *Biostatistics* (2019) – Trial duration estimates\n- JAMA Network Open (2024) – R&D cost benchmarks\n- ACSH (2020) – Therapeutic area success profiles\n\n### Application Architecture\n\n- R Shiny with shiny.semantic (Appsilon framework)\n- Modular architecture (4 independent tabs)\n- ggiraph + fmsb for interactive visualizations\n- reactable for data tables\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Purpose, Scope, and Disclaimer\n\nThis simulator is an independent analytical exercise created for\nportfolio and educational purposes only.\n\nIt is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or produced by any pharmaceutical company.\n\nAll parameters are derived from publicly available peer-reviewed literature.\nNo representation is made regarding applicability to specific company contexts.\n\nThis work does not constitute investment advice, clinical guidance, or\nstrategic recommendations.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Closing\n\nThis project demonstrates how **analytical restraint, transparency, and multi-objective framing** can be combined into an executive-grade decision-support application.\n\nBy focusing on structure rather than prediction, the simulator helps clarify *how* strategic choices behave—without claiming to know *what* should be chosen.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n",
