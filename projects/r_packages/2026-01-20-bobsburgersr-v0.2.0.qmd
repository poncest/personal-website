## bobsburgersR v0.2.0 is Here!

I'm excited to announce the release of **bobsburgersR v0.2.0**! This
update brings the package up to date with seasons 15 and 16, expanding
coverage to **309 episodes** across all 16 seasons of *Bob's Burgers*.

## What's New

### Seasons 15-16 Added

The dataset now includes the latest episodes, bringing the total from
275 to **309 episodes**. Transcript data has also been updated to
**204,027 lines** of dialogue.

### New Rating Source: TMDB

The most significant change in this release is the switch from IMDb to
[TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) (The Movie Database) for episode
ratings. IMDb implemented bot protection in 2024 that prevents web
scraping, so I migrated to TMDB's official API.

Both rating systems use a 1-10 scale, but they come from different user
communities. If you're comparing ratings across package versions, keep
this in mind.

**Stay tuned for a follow-up post where I'll explore how these TMDB
ratings compare across the show's 16-season history.**

### New Data Columns

The `episode_data` dataset now includes:

-   `votes` — Number of TMDB user votes for each episode
-   `tmdb_id` — Unique TMDB episode identifier
-   `runtime` — Episode length in minutes

## Breaking Changes

**Dataset renamed:** `imdb_wikipedia_data` is now `episode_data`. Update
your code accordingly:

``` r
# Old (no longer works)
data("imdb_wikipedia_data")

# New
data("episode_data")
```

**Column renamed:** `wikipedia_viewers` is now `us_viewers_millions` for
clarity.

**Column renamed:** `imdb_title` is now `title`.

## Bug Fixes

Fixed carriage return characters (`\r`) in transcript data for seasons
13-14 that caused display issues.

## Installation

Install or update from GitHub:

```{r}
#| label: install
#| eval: false

# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("poncest/bobsburgersR")
```

## Quick Example

```{r}
#| label: example
#| eval: true

library(bobsburgersR)
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))

data("episode_data")

# Check the data
cat("Total episodes:", nrow(episode_data), "\n")
cat("Seasons:", paste(range(episode_data$season), collapse = "-"), "\n")

# Average rating by season
episode_data |>
  group_by(season) |>
  summarise(
    episodes = n(),
    avg_rating = round(mean(rating, na.rm = TRUE), 1),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) |>
  print(n = 16)
```

## What's Next

I'll continue updating **bobsburgersR** as new episodes air. If you have
