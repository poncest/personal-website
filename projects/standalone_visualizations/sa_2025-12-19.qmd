## Why this project 

Most dashboards fail not because of poor data, but because they try to serve everyone at once. This project explores how to design a single Shiny application that supports executive, operations, and revenue decisions—without sacrificing clarity, performance, or trust.

This project explores how to design a **single Shiny application** that supports three distinct decision-makers—without sacrificing usability, performance, or narrative focus. The goal was not to visualize everything, but to help the *right people* answer the *right questions* quickly.

> **Note:** All data, benchmarks, and financial impacts shown here are **synthetic and illustrative**, used solely to demonstrate analytical thinking and dashboard design.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The challenge

Rail operations generate vast amounts of data—journeys, delays, ticket sales, booking patterns—but these signals are often fragmented across systems. As a result:

- Executives struggle to spot performance shifts quickly
- Operations teams lack a unified view of delay drivers
- Revenue analysts miss cross-route pricing and concentration risks

The challenge wasn't building *a* dashboard. It was building **three dashboards in one**, each tailored to a distinct stakeholder—without creating a cluttered, one-size-fits-all interface that satisfies no one.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Designing for three personas

Rather than present everything at once, the dashboard is structured around three clear use cases.

### Executive overview

**Purpose:** Monitor performance at a glance, identify trends, and surface opportunities

**Key elements:**

- Four headline KPIs with month-over-month trend indicators
- A one-sentence executive takeaway using consulting-style language
- Daily journey volume trends for context
- A concise insights panel summarizing what matters most

### Operations analytics

**Purpose:** Diagnose delay drivers and prioritize operational interventions

**Key elements:**

- Time-period filtering (Morning Peak, Evening Peak, Off-Peak)
- Route-level delay rate analysis
- Delay reason breakdown highlighting root causes
- Severity distribution showing operational impact

### Revenue intelligence

**Purpose:** Analyze booking behavior, pricing patterns, and revenue concentration

**Key elements:**

- Booking window analysis (same-day vs. advance)
- Revenue by time period
- Ticket price distribution
- Channel performance (online vs. station)
- Route-level revenue concentration metrics

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Key insights from the data

### Network performance (Jan–Apr 2024)

**Takeaway:** Reliability is strong, but volume softness and delay duration still pose risk.

- 31,653 journeys generated £742k in revenue (£23.44 average fare)
- 92.8% on-time performance (above 89% industry benchmark)
- 7.2% delay rate, with average delays of 42.5 minutes when they occur

### Route concentration risk

**Takeaway:** A small number of routes drive a disproportionate share of value.

- Top 5 routes account for 28% of total journey volume
- Manchester Piccadilly → Liverpool Lime Street leads with 5,128 journeys
- Top 10 routes represent 45% of total revenue, increasing concentration risk

### Operational patterns

**Takeaway:** Delays cluster in predictable windows, enabling targeted intervention.

- Morning Peak has the highest delay rate (12.5%)
- Weather is the leading delay cause (42.8%), followed by Technical Issues (18.3%)
- Delay patterns are consistent by time period, not random

### Digital adoption gap

**Takeaway:** Channel migration represents a clear near-term opportunity.

- 58.5% digital adoption vs. 65% industry benchmark
- Online channel generates 51.6% of revenue despite 58.5% of volume
- Lower average online fares suggest pricing or product mix opportunity

### Revenue optimization potential

**Takeaway:** Yield management levers remain underutilized.

- Peak fares are +40.3% higher than off-peak
- Only 12.1% of tickets are purchased 8+ days in advance
- 62% of tickets fall in the "Budget" category (<£15)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Design decisions that elevated the dashboard

Five specific choices that elevated usability and stakeholder engagement:

### 1. Executive takeaway box

A single, consulting-style summary at the top of the Executive tab reframed how users engage:

> *Core service reliability remains strong (92.8% on-time), while recent softness in journey volume and sub-benchmark digital adoption indicate near-term opportunities in demand stimulation and channel migration.*

This immediately answers: *What's working? What's not? What should we do next?*

### 2. Trend indicators on KPIs

Month-over-month arrows provide context that raw numbers cannot. Executives care more about **direction** than magnitude.

### 3. Info tooltips for clarity

Subtle ℹ️ icons explain metrics like "Digital Adoption" without cluttering the interface, reducing friction for new users.

### 4. Unified visual language

A restrained color palette replaced early rainbow gradients, resulting in a cohesive, consulting-grade aesthetic.

### 5. Horizontal bar charts

Long route and time-period labels remain readable, reducing cognitive load and improving scanability.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Technical architecture

The application uses a **modular Shiny architecture** optimized for performance through aggressive reactive caching.

### Core structure

- `app.R` — Main application entry point
- `R/mod_executive.R` — Executive overview module
- `R/mod_operations.R` — Operations analytics module
- `R/mod_revenue.R` — Revenue intelligence module

### Technology stack

- **shiny.semantic** — Modern Semantic UI framework
- **ggiraph** — Interactive, hover-enabled charts
- **reactable** — Professional data tables
- **ggplot2 + dplyr + tidyr** — Data manipulation and visualization
- **bindCache()** — Reactive caching for performance

### Performance results

- Initial load time reduced from ~8–10 seconds to <2 seconds
- Expensive computations cached
- Summary metrics pre-aggregated

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Making the dashboard production-ready

### Dependency management

- Removed all `install.packages()` calls from runtime code
- Used explicit package imports
- Excluded development artifacts via `.rscignore`

### Modal implementation

- Used Semantic UI modals (`create_modal()`) instead of `shiny::modalDialog()`
- Ensured reliable triggering via JavaScript event handling

### Deployment

```r
rsconnect::deployApp(
  appName = "UK_train_operations",
  forceUpdate = TRUE
)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Strategic recommendations

The following recommendations are illustrative examples of how this dashboard could support strategic decision-making.

### 1. Channel migration initiative

**Goal:** Increase digital adoption from 58.5% → 65%

**Tactics:**

- Incentivize first-time online booking
- Improve mobile UX
- Expand digital partnerships

**Expected impact:** +£45k annual revenue (illustrative)

### 2. Peak period capacity management

**Goal:** Reduce Morning Peak delay rate from 12.5% → 9.0%

**Tactics:**

- Add rolling stock on high-impact routes
- Dynamic crew scheduling

**Expected impact:** +3.5pp on-time performance

### 3. Revenue optimization

**Goal:** Increase advance booking rate from 12.1% → 18%

**Tactics:**

- Advance-purchase discounts
- Fare bundling experiments

**Expected impact:** +£28k annual revenue (illustrative)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Five lessons from building executive-grade dashboards

1. **Clarity beats completeness** — Fewer metrics, better decisions
2. **Performance matters** — Slow dashboards don't get used
3. **Language matters** — Consulting-style framing builds credibility
4. **Design is strategic** — UX decisions shape adoption
5. **Documentation is part of the product** — Explaining *why* matters as much as *how*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Potential extensions

If this were a production deployment, next priorities would include:

- Predictive delay forecasting using historical patterns
- Automated alert system for performance anomalies
- Integration with real-time operations data
- Mobile-optimized responsive design
- Multi-language support for international routes

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Closing takeaway

Effective business intelligence isn't about showing all available data—it's about answering the right questions for the right people. In dashboard design and stakeholder communication alike, **clarity consistently beats complexity**.
