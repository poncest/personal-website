> *The core challenge in launch planning isn't predicting success—it's
> quantifying how much uncertainty costs when timing shifts.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [1. Framing the problem]{.smallcaps}

Pre-launch planning in pharmaceutical commercialization involves
decisions under substantial uncertainty. Brand teams must commit to
launch timing, resource allocation, and forecast ranges while facing
unknowns about regulatory approval timing, manufacturing readiness, and
market reception.

The natural instinct is to seek precision: better models, more data,
tighter confidence intervals. But in practice, the harder problem is
often **structuring the conversation** around forecast ranges,
revenue-at-risk, and timing shifts—rather than eliminating uncertainty
entirely.

This project approaches launch forecasting as a **governance and framing
problem**, rather than a prediction exercise. The objective is not to
forecast whether a specific launch will succeed, but to quantify **how
analog selection and timing assumptions translate into revenue
risk**—making trade-offs explicit for cross-functional discussion.

In practice, this means shifting the question from "What will happen?"
to "What are we implicitly assuming—and what does that assumption cost
if it's wrong?"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [2. The core decision question]{.smallcaps}

The framework is designed around a single, actionable question:

**What is the revenue at risk if launch timing shifts under
uncertainty?**

This question matters because it connects analytical work directly to
decisions that leadership teams actually face:

-   How much revenue exposure exists in Year 1 if launch slips by one or
    two quarters?
-   What forecast commitment range (P25/P50/P75) is defensible given
    analog variation?
-   How sensitive are these conclusions to which analogs are included?

In practice, timing assumptions also propagate into manufacturing
readiness, commercial resourcing, and financial guidance—making early
uncertainty costly to unwind later.

Rather than producing point forecasts, the framework surfaces **ranges
and trade-offs** that support structured executive discussion.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [3. Why governance-first analog selection]{.smallcaps}

Analog-based forecasting is common in pharmaceutical commercial
planning. The challenge is that analog selection is inherently
subjective—and post-hoc adjustments can undermine credibility.

This framework applies a **governance-first methodology**:

1.  **Define inclusion criteria before examining outcomes** —
    Therapeutic area, peak revenue threshold, and data availability
    requirements are specified upfront.
2.  **Lock the analog list in writing** — No modifications after seeing
    revenue performance.
3.  **Document rationale for every inclusion/exclusion** — Creates an
    audit trail for reviewers.
4.  **Test sensitivity explicitly** — Option to exclude the
    top-performing analog tests whether conclusions depend on outliers.

This approach addresses a common critique of analog analysis: that
analysts cherry-pick comparators to support predetermined conclusions.
By separating selection criteria from outcome examination, the framework
survives skeptical review.

This governance-first approach is operationalized in the app through
four components: **Executive Brief** (scenario comparison and trade-off
framing), **Scenario Builder** (criteria configuration and sensitivity
testing), **Analog Explorer** (individual product examination with
guardrails), and **Methods & Data** (assumption documentation and scope
boundaries).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [4. What the framework quantifies]{.smallcaps}

### Revenue-at-Risk Estimation

The framework calculates Year 1 revenue at risk under configurable
launch delay scenarios:

```         
Revenue at Risk (Year 1) = delay_quarters × (median Year 1 revenue / 4)
```

Year 1 is used because it is the period most sensitive to launch timing
assumptions and the least confounded by later competitive or lifecycle
effects.

This is explicitly labeled as a **Year 1 average-quarter
approximation**—a simplification that provides directional magnitude
without implying DCF-level precision.

### Scenario Bands from Analog Variation

Percentile bands (P25/P50/P75) are derived from observed analog
performance:

-   **P50 (Base Case):** Median analog trajectory
-   **P75 (Upper Range):** Upper quartile performance
-   **P25 (Lower Range):** Lower quartile performance

These represent **observed variation across analogs**, not statistical
confidence intervals. The distinction matters: they quantify historical
heterogeneity, not forecasting uncertainty.

### Selection Statistics

Dynamic statistics update as criteria change:

-   Solid tumor vs. hematology count
-   Approval year range
-   Median peak revenue
-   Number of analogs meeting criteria

This transparency helps users understand what's driving the scenario
range.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [5. Key assumptions documented]{.smallcaps}

The framework relies on several simplifying assumptions that users
should understand:

**Demand deferral, not destruction**\
Delayed demand is assumed to shift forward in time rather than being
permanently lost. Competitive dynamics and access erosion are not
modeled.

**Label expansion bias**\
Some analogs experienced significant post-launch indication expansions,
creating potential upward bias in peak revenue estimates. Products
without similar expansion potential may underperform these benchmarks.

**Era effects**\
Launch dynamics differ between earlier (2013–2015) and more recent
oncology approvals. The analog set includes both eras, which may
introduce heterogeneity.

**US-weighted revenue**\
SEC filing data may include global revenue. Geographic mix differences
between analogs and forecasted products are not adjusted.

These assumptions are documented in the Methods & Data tab and surfaced
in the dashboard interface to prevent over-interpretation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [6. What this framework does—and does not—do]{.smallcaps}

### What it does

✅ Structures analog-based launch scenario analysis\
✅ Quantifies revenue ranges from analog variation (P25/P50/P75)\
✅ Supports structured trade-off conversations under uncertainty\
✅ Documents assumptions and limitations transparently\
✅ Provides sensitivity checks to test analytical robustness

### What it does not do

❌ Predict whether a specific launch will succeed\
❌ Recommend specific investment or resourcing levels\
❌ Model competitive response or market access dynamics\
❌ Estimate NPV or financial returns\
❌ Replace clinical, regulatory, or strategic judgment

**By design:** NPV and market access modeling are excluded because they
require company-specific inputs that would compromise generalizability.
Revenue scenarios are treated as **foundational inputs** to financial
modeling, not final outputs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [7. Dashboard structure]{.smallcaps}

The application is organized into four complementary views:

### Executive Brief

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/poncest/launch-curve-forecaster/main/screenshots/executive_brief.png)

An executive-facing summary that surfaces:

-   Key metrics (analog count, peak revenue range, revenue at risk)
-   Launch trajectory scenarios with P25/P50/P75 bands
-   Two explicit decision trade-offs: launch timing and forecast
    commitment
-   Selected analog summary table

The decision boxes explicitly frame trade-offs in terms stakeholders
recognize: "Speed vs. readiness" and "Alignment vs. credibility risk."

### Scenario Builder

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/poncest/launch-curve-forecaster/main/screenshots/scenario_builder.png)

An interactive configuration view that allows users to:

-   Select therapeutic focus (solid tumors, hematology, or both)
-   Set minimum peak revenue thresholds
-   Test sensitivity by excluding the top-performing analog
-   Configure launch delay scenarios (0–4 quarters)

The Selection Rationale panel updates dynamically, showing live
statistics and a governance note reminding users that criteria should be
documented before examining outcomes.

### Analog Explorer

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/poncest/launch-curve-forecaster/main/screenshots/analog_explorer.png)

A detailed view for examining individual analog characteristics:

-   Side-by-side comparison of two selected analogs
-   Launch curve visualization showing trajectory differences
-   Characteristics table (company, indication, approval date, peak
    revenue)
-   Launch context factors that may have influenced trajectory

This tab includes guardrails against over-interpretation—users must
click "View Details" to load data, creating a deliberate interaction
that discourages casual browsing.

### Methods & Data

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/poncest/launch-curve-forecaster/main/screenshots/methods.png)

A transparency-focused section documenting:

-   Framework overview and workflow diagram
-   Data sources (FDA approvals, SEC EDGAR filings, published
    literature)
-   Inclusion and exclusion criteria
-   Key assumptions with explicit discussion
-   "What This Framework Does NOT Do" section
-   Technical implementation details

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [8. The analog set]{.smallcaps}

The framework includes 10 established oncology launches with
product-level revenue disclosed in SEC filings:

**Solid tumors (6):**\
Keytruda, Opdivo, Ibrance, Tagrisso, Lynparza, Tecentriq

**Hematology (4):**\
Imbruvica, Darzalex, Venclexta, Calquence

The 6/4 split reflects real-world prevalence rather than forced
symmetry. Adding weaker products to achieve balance would introduce more
noise than signal.

Approval years range from 2013–2017, providing sufficient follow-up to
observe peak revenue while remaining recent enough to reflect modern
launch dynamics.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [9. Technical lessons from the build]{.smallcaps}

This project surfaced an important technical insight about Shiny
development with CSS-based UI frameworks.

### The Problem

When using shiny.semantic (which relies on Semantic UI's CSS-based tab
switching), outputs don't render automatically when users navigate to a
tab. Shiny's lazy evaluation assumes it knows when tabs become
visible—but CSS-based tabs don't notify Shiny of visibility changes.

### The Solution

Adding `outputOptions(output, "output_name", suspendWhenHidden = FALSE)`
to all outputs forces Shiny to render regardless of perceived
visibility. This pattern isn't documented in standard Shiny guides but
is essential for CSS-based tab frameworks.

This discovery—after several hours of debugging—became the most valuable
technical lesson from the project.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [10. Why this framing matters for commercial analytics]{.smallcaps}

In pharmaceutical commercial planning, forecasts are rarely wrong
because of poor algorithms. They're wrong because:

-   Analog selection was post-hoc rationalized
-   Assumptions weren't documented or tested
-   Ranges were too narrow to capture actual uncertainty
-   Trade-offs weren't made explicit to decision-makers

This framework addresses these failure modes directly:

-   **Governance-first selection** prevents cherry-picking
-   **Documented assumptions** create audit trails
-   **P25/P50/P75 bands** acknowledge inherent uncertainty
-   **Explicit trade-off framing** connects analysis to decisions

The goal is not better predictions, but **better-structured
conversations** about what forecasts can and cannot support.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Closing Reflection

::: callout-note
The value of this framework lies not in its predictions, but in its
structure. By making analog selection defensible, assumptions
transparent, and trade-offs explicit, it provides a foundation for
**disciplined commercial planning conversations**—conversations that
connect forecast ranges to revenue-at-risk and timing decisions to
resource commitments.

In launch planning, clarity about what we don't know is often more
valuable than false confidence about what we do.
