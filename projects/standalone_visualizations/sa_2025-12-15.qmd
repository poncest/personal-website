------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Opportunity

NASA’s meteorite landings dataset documents **45,716 meteorite discoveries** from **860 CE to 2013**—over 1,150 years of recorded encounters with material from space.

This project began with a simple goal: **turn a large historical dataset into an intuitive, interactive experience** that allows users to explore where meteorites were found, how discoveries changed over time, and what distinguishes rare observed falls from later recoveries.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Guiding Questions

To shape the dashboard, I focused on a small set of questions that naturally emerge from the data:

**Geography**

-   Where are meteorite discoveries concentrated globally?
-   Why does Antarctica dominate modern records?

**Time**

-   How have discoveries evolved over time?
-   What explains the sharp rise in finds after 1970?

**Physical Characteristics**

-   How do observed falls differ from recovered meteorites?
-   Which meteorite types appear most frequently?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Design Approach: Progressive Disclosure

The dashboard follows a **progressive disclosure** strategy: present the big picture first, then allow deeper exploration for users who want it.

### Global Overview

The opening view provides immediate context through four headline metrics:

-   **Total meteorites**: 45,716
-   **Largest find**: Hoba (\~60 tonnes)
-   **Time span**: 860–2013
-   **Observed falls**: 2.4%

![Global Overview tab showing worldwide meteorite locations, discovery trends over time, and mass distributions for observed falls versus recovered finds.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/poncest/Meteorite_Landings/main/screenshots/global-overview.png){#fig-1}

These are paired with three core visualizations:

1.  **Interactive world map** showing all meteorite locations with clustering for performance
2.  **Discovery timeline** highlighting the rapid increase in finds since the 19th century
3.  **Mass distribution** comparing observed falls versus recovered meteorites

A simple year-range filter allows users to focus on specific historical periods without overwhelming the interface.

### Deep Dive Analytics

For more detailed exploration, the analytics tab adds multidimensional filters:

-   Year range
-   Mass range (log scale)
-   Meteorite classification
-   Discovery status (Fell vs. Found)

All visualizations and summary statistics update reactively, allowing users to explore relationships across time, mass, and type.

### Data Explorer

The final tab exposes the underlying dataset through an interactive table, supporting:

-   Search and column-level filtering
-   Sorting
-   CSV export for external analysis

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Key Patterns Revealed by the Data

### Antarctica’s Outsized Role

Modern meteorite discoveries are dominated by Antarctica. The ice sheet acts as a natural conveyor belt, concentrating meteorites in accessible regions. Dark stones contrast sharply against the ice, and cold, dry conditions preserve specimens exceptionally well.

### The Post-1970 Discovery Surge

The dramatic rise in discoveries after 1970 reflects **improved search efforts**, not an increase in meteorite impacts. Antarctic expeditions, desert surveys, and systematic recovery programs fundamentally changed how meteorites are found.

### Fell vs. Found

Only **1,097 meteorites (2.4%)** were observed falling. These events are scientifically valuable because their arrival time is precisely known. Recovered meteorites, which make up the remaining 97.6%, are often larger and discovered long after impact.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Design Decisions That Improved Clarity

### Consistency Over Color

Early versions of the dashboard used multiple accent colors for value boxes, creating visual noise. Switching to **uniform white cards** with subtle borders improved readability and gave the dashboard a more professional, consulting-style appearance.

### Standardized Layout

Both main tabs follow the same structure:

1.  Key metrics
2.  Optional filters
3.  Detailed charts

This consistency reduces cognitive load and helps users quickly understand how to navigate the dashboard.

### Unified Interactivity

All charts use **ggiraph** for hover-based interaction, ensuring a consistent interaction model across maps, timelines, and distributions.

## Technical Overview

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
### Architecture & Stack

The app uses a modular Shiny architecture:

-   **UI**: `ui_main.R`, `ui_tabs.R`
-   **Server**: `server.R`, `server_charts.R`
-   **Global setup**: `global.R`

**Core technologies**:

-   R Shiny + shinydashboard

-   ggiraph (interactive charts)

-   leaflet (mapping)

-   DT (data tables)

-   dplyr / ggplot2 (data manipulation and visualization)

## Deployment Lessons 

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
##### Expand for Deployment Notes

**Dependency Management**
- Spatial packages (`terra`, `raster`) require explicit declaration in DESCRIPTION
- Indirect dependencies must be captured in `renv.lock` with `renv::snapshot()`

**Performance Optimization**  
- Binary data formats (`.rds`) load ~10x faster than text formats (`.csv`)
- Essential for meeting shinyapps.io's 60-second startup limit

**Reproducibility**
- Lock all dependencies early to avoid deployment surprises
- Test with `rsconnect::appDependencies()` before deploying

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Closing Takeaway

::: {.callout-note}

This project reinforced a simple but powerful lesson: effective dashboards are designed, not assembled.
Clarity, consistency, and restraint mattered more than adding features — both in code and in communication.
