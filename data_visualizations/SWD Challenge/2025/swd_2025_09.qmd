## The Challenge

This month's Storytelling with Data challenge focused on **"Dashboards that Deliver"** - revisiting existing dashboards to make them more focused and user-centric. I chose to redesign my own traffic flow dashboard using the TidyTuesday (2024 wk 49) National Highways Traffic Flow dataset.

## The Problem: Information Overload

### Original Dashboard - The "Before"

![Baseline dashboard with multiple tabs, cluttered interface, and unclear focus](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/poncest/SWDchallenge/main/2025/09_Sep/img/01_before_app.PNG){#fig-before}

**Key Issues Identified:**

-   **Multiple tabs** scattered related insights across different views
-   **Too many controls** (sensor picker, date range, day type, hour slider, plotly toggle, KPI toggle)
-   **Unclear audience** - tried to serve everyone, served no one well
-   **No visual hierarchy** - everything competed for attention
-   **Analysis paralysis** - users didn't know where to start or what questions to ask

The original dashboard suffered from a common problem: attempting to show *everything* at once rather than guiding users toward the most important insights.

## Audience & Analytical Needs

### Target Users: Transport Planners & Local Policy Staff

**Primary Questions They Need Answered:**

1.  **How is daily volume trending this month?** (For capacity planning)
2.  **What's the weekday vs weekend hourly profile?** (For staffing and maintenance scheduling)\
3.  **Which sensor shows consistently different patterns?** (For identifying problem areas)

**Secondary Needs:**

-   Quick overview metrics at a glance
-   Ability to focus on specific date ranges
-   Simple comparison between weekday/weekend patterns
-   Minimal cognitive load - they're busy people

## The Solution: Focused Clarity

### Redesigned Dashboard - The "After"

### Key Design Decisions

**1. Single Page Layout**

-   Eliminated tabs to keep related insights together
-   Created clear visual hierarchy with KPIs at top

**2. Streamlined Controls (3 vs 8)**

-   Date range selector (essential for time-series analysis)
-   Sensor selection (allows focus on specific locations)
-   Weekday/Weekend toggle (key operational insight)

**3. Strategic KPIs**

-   **Avg daily volume:** 28,906 (capacity planning)
-   **Median speed:** 44 mph (performance monitoring)
-   **% large vehicles:** 3.8% (infrastructure wear planning)

**4. Two Focused Charts** - **Daily traffic volume** with trend line (answers trending question) - **Weekday vs Weekend profile** (answers operational scheduling question)

## Interactive Versions

-   **Baseline App (Before):** https://0l6jpd-steven-ponce.shinyapps.io/01_before_app/
-   **Makeover App (After):** https://0l6jpd-steven-ponce.shinyapps.io/02_after_app/

*Navigation: Use the simple sidebar controls to filter by date range, select specific sensors, or toggle between weekday and weekend patterns.*

## Design Impact & Results

### What Changed

-   **Reduced cognitive load** from 8 controls to 3
-   **Eliminated navigation** from 5 tabs to 1 page
-   **Focused insights** from scattered metrics to strategic KPIs
-   **Clear visual hierarchy** guiding users from summary to detail

### Questions Now Easily Answered

✅ **"How's traffic trending?"** - Immediately visible in main chart with trend line\
✅ **"When are peak hours?"** - Clear hourly profile shows morning/evening peaks\
✅ **"Weekend vs weekday differences?"** - Toggle comparison built into interface\
✅ **"Which location needs attention?"** - Sensor comparison readily available

### What Users Gain

-   **Faster insights** - key metrics visible within seconds
-   **Actionable intelligence** - focused on decisions they actually need to make
-   **Reduced training time** - intuitive interface needs minimal explanation
-   **Mobile-friendly** - simplified layout works on smaller screens

## Technical Implementation

The redesign was built using R Shiny with the National Highways Traffic Flow dataset from TidyTuesday 2024 Week 49, covering A64 road sensors during May 2021.

### Data Source Details

-   **Source:** WebTRIS Traffic Flow API via TidyTuesday (2024 wk 49)
-   **Coverage:** 4 sensors on A64 road, May 2021
-   **Granularity:** Hourly vehicle counts, speeds, and size classifications
-   **Volume:** \~30K daily average across all sensors

### Key Technical Choices

-   **Single reactive dataset** instead of multiple data processing streams
-   **Conditional rendering** based on user selections rather than separate tabs
-   **Optimized calculations** focusing on the three key metrics that matter most
-   **Simplified interactivity** - removed unnecessary plotly complexity

## Reflection & Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

-   **Less is more** - Removing features improved usability dramatically
-   **User-centered design** - Focusing on specific audience transformed the experience
-   **Visual hierarchy** - Clear information architecture guides user attention effectively

### What I'd Do Differently Next Time

-   **User testing** - Would validate assumptions with actual transport planners
-   **Progressive disclosure** - Could add "deep dive" option for power users
-   **Contextual help** - Brief explanations of what "good" looks like for each metric

### Key Takeaway

The most powerful dashboards don't show everything possible - they show everything *necessary* for specific users to make specific decisions.
