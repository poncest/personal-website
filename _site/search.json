    "text": "Figure 1: Scatter plot testing Swiss folklore that a faster Böögg explosion predicts a hotter summer. A dotted diagonal line shows the expected negative relationship, but the data contradicts it: record hot summers (large red points above 19°C threshold) are scattered across all burn durations from 4 to 60 minutes. The 2003 European heat wave had a fast 7-minute burn, while 2023’s record summer had a slow 57-minute burn.

Points cluster along the diagonal ‘no change’ line, mostly within 70-80%, indicating minimal seasonal variation. Blue points represent indoor cats, orange points represent indoor & outdoor cats. Right panel: Dot plots showing resting time by household environment. Cats in homes with children rest slightly less (~70%) than those without (~75%), while dog presence shows minimal difference.
