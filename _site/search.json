    "text": "Figure 1: Scatter plot testing Swiss folklore that a faster Böögg explosion predicts a hotter summer. A dotted diagonal line shows the expected negative relationship, but the data contradicts it: record hot summers (large red points above 19°C threshold) are scattered across all burn durations from 4 to 60 minutes. The 2003 European heat wave had a fast 7-minute burn, while 2023’s record summer had a slow 57-minute burn. Correlation is +0.19, opposite to folklore’s prediction.\n\n\nSteps to Create this Graphic \n1.

A dotted diagonal line shows the expected negative relationship, but the data contradicts it: record hot summers (large red points above 19°C threshold) are scattered across all burn durations from 4 to 60 minutes. The 2003 European heat wave had a fast 7-minute burn, while 2023’s record summer had a slow 57-minute burn. Correlation is +0.19, opposite to folklore’s prediction.\n\n\n\n\n9.

The top panel displays performance cards for the six best models (Claude 4.1 Opus, Claude 4.5 Sonnet, Grok 4, Magistral Medium 7.2, GPT-5 high, and Kimi K2 0905) with their accuracy, hallucination rates, and combined scores. The bottom panel shows a scatterplot of all 18 models, plotting accuracy versus hallucination rate, with the top 6 models labeled and highlighted. Proprietary models (blue) cluster in the high accuracy, low hallucination zone, while open-weight models (coral) show more varied performance.\n\n\nSteps to Create this Graphic \n1.

Density contours reveal four distinct market segments divided by vertical lines: Budget ($12k-25k), Mid-Range ($25k-75k), Premium ($75k-250k), and Ultra-Luxury ($250k+). Points are colored by engine type (teal for electric, orange for hybrid, dark gray for petrol). The majority of vehicles cluster in the budget and mid-range segments below 500 horsepower.

Although the USA has the highest total number of roundabouts at 12,952 (represented by the largest bubble on the plot), it ranks near the median with only 39 roundabouts per million residents due to its large population.

    "text": "Key Patterns Revealed by the Data\nAntarctica’s Outsized Role\nModern meteorite discoveries are dominated by Antarctica. The ice sheet acts as a natural conveyor belt, concentrating meteorites in accessible regions. Dark stones contrast sharply against the ice, and cold, dry conditions preserve specimens exceptionally well.\nThe Post-1970 Discovery Surge\nThe dramatic rise in discoveries after 1970 reflects improved search efforts, not an increase in meteorite impacts. Antarctic expeditions, desert surveys, and systematic recovery programs fundamentally changed how meteorites are found.\nFell vs. Found\nOnly 1,097 meteorites (2.4%) were observed falling. These events are scientifically valuable because their arrival time is precisely known. Recovered meteorites, which make up the remaining 97.6%, are often larger and discovered long after impact."

    "text": "Original\nThe original visualization comes from London crimes by income deprivation decile\n\n\nOriginal visualization\n\nMakeover\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Area chart showing estimated crime rates per 10,000 residents across London’s income deprivation deciles, from most deprived (1) to least deprived (10). Crime rates are much higher in more deprived areas: the most deprived decile has about 1,656 crimes per 10,000 residents, which is roughly 134% higher than the least deprived decile at about 707. Rates peak around the second and third-most deprived deciles and then decline steadily toward the least deprived areas. Rates are based on equal-population estimates per decile and should be interpreted comparatively rather than as exact values.\n\n\nMethodology & Data Sources\nPopulation Estimates & Per Capita Calculations\nThis analysis uses per capita crime rates (crimes per 10,000 residents) rather than raw counts to enable fair comparison across income deprivation deciles. Since population data aggregated by income deprivation decile was not readily available, we estimated populations based on:\n\n\nLondon LSOA count: 4,835 Lower Layer Super Output Areas (London Datastore)\n\nAverage LSOA population: 1,722 residents\n\nEstimated population per decile: ~833,000 residents (assuming roughly equal distribution)\n\nTotal estimated: 8.33 million (vs. 8.9 million actual London population, 2021 Census)\n\nNote: Trust for London uses London-rebased income deprivation deciles, ranking only London’s 4,835 LSOAs into deciles (not England-wide rankings).\nCritical Limitations & Assumptions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Assumptions About Population Estimates\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Equal Distribution Assumption - We assume approximately equal population across all 10 income deprivation deciles - Each decile: ~483-484 LSOAs × 1,722 residents = ~833,000 people - This is a simplification - actual populations likely vary by decile\n2. Why Estimates Were Necessary - IoD2025 File 7 (official population denominators) was not accessible - No readily available population data aggregated by income deprivation decile - Per capita analysis requires population denominators for meaningful comparison\n3. Validity of Findings - Under equal-population assumption: 134% difference persists (raw counts = per capita rates) - This suggests the crime disparity is real, not merely a population artifact - More deprived areas may have different population density than affluent areas\n4. Interpretation Guidance - Per capita rates shown are based on estimated, not actual, populations - True rates may vary if actual population distribution differs significantly - Treat values as comparative rather than exact - All visualizations note this limitation in titles/subtitles/captions\n\n\n\nData Preparation Pipeline\nThe CSV files used in this analysis were generated using a Python preprocessing script that calculated per capita crime rates with population estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReproducibility: Data Preparation Steps\n\n\n\n\n\nTo reproduce the analysis from raw data:\n\n\nRun the Python preprocessing script:\n\nScript: mm_2025_week49_prep.py\n\nInput: mom_week49_data.csv (raw crime counts from data.world)\nOutput: Two tidy CSV files with per capita rates\n\n\n\nRun the R visualization script (this document)\n\nUses the pre-calculated per capita rates\nCreates the final visualization\n\n\n\nThe Python script documents: - Population estimation methodology (4,835 LSOAs × 1,722 avg residents) - Per capita rate calculations (crimes per 10,000 residents)\n- All assumptions and limitations (detailed above)\nRepository: MakeoverMonday/2025/Week_49\n\n\n\nData Sources\n\n\nCrime Data: Trust for London, DataPoliceUK (January-December 2024)\n\nDeprivation Rankings: Indices of Multiple Deprivation 2025 (IoD2025)\n\nPopulation Reference: London Datastore - LSOA Atlas\n\n\nChallenge Data: data.world - MakeoverMonday Week 49\n\nSteps to Create this Graphic \n1.

    "section": "Why this project",
    "text": "Why this project\nESG dashboards often show what happened without explaining what it means strategically. This project explores how to transform publicly available emissions data into a strategic decision-support tool using consulting frameworks—risk matrices, controllability analysis, and scenario planning.\nThe goal wasn’t to visualize every data point, but to answer the questions executives and analysts actually ask: Where has real progress occurred? What constraints do we face? What tradeoffs must leadership consider?\n\nNote: This is an independent portfolio project using publicly available Apple Environmental Progress Reports.

    "section": "Design decisions that elevated the analysis",
    "text": "Design decisions that elevated the analysis\nFive specific choices that transformed this from a data visualization into a strategic tool:\n1. Controllability framework over scope categories\nInstead of just showing Scope 1/2/3 (the standard ESG view), the dashboard classifies sources by Apple’s actual influence:\n\n\nHigh Control: Corporate facilities, product design, packaging\n\nMedium Control: Supplier contracts, component specs, transportation\n\nLow Control: Customer behavior, grid electricity mix, end-of-life\n\nThis reframes the conversation from “what are the emissions?” to “what can we actually do about them?”\n2. Risk matrix for strategic prioritization\nThe scatter plot of Controllability × Impact immediately reveals:\n\n\nTop-right quadrant (High Impact, High Control): Strategic opportunities—go here first\n\nTop-left quadrant (High Impact, Low Control): Strategic risks—requires partnerships, policy, or innovation\nBottom quadrants: Lower priority\n\nThis gives executives a clear framework for resource allocation.\n3. Scenario planning over historical reporting\nThe “What if Scope 3 stalls?” slider lets users see the implications of different reduction trajectories:\n\nAt 5% annual reduction → Still 65% of current emissions in 2030\nAt 10% annual reduction → Net zero achievable but requires sustained execution\nAt 0% reduction → 2030 target becomes unrealistic\n\nThis shifts the conversation from “are we on track?” to “what would it take to get there?”\n4. Strategic options table instead of recommendations\nRather than prescribe a single path, the dashboard presents four strategic options with explicit tradeoffs:\n\nAggressive supplier contracts (near-term, addressable now, relationship risk)\nBreakthrough R&D investment (long-term, high potential, uncertain timeline)\nCircular economy pivot (transformative, revenue model risk, 10+ year horizon)\nTransparent timeline revision (credible, PR risk, avoids missed target)\n\nThis acknowledges complexity and respects that leadership must balance competing priorities.\n5. Consulting language throughout\nExamples of language refinements:\n\n“Likely requires” instead of “demands” (acknowledges uncertainty)\n“Should prioritize” instead of “must prioritize” (advisory not prescriptive)\n“Mathematically impossible” instead of “impossible” (clarifies it’s calculation, not hyperbole)\n“Based on current trends” instead of absolute claims (appropriate hedging)\n\nThis tone signals professional judgment and strategic thinking."
